# WebAR using Opencv.js and Three.js

This is a small demo of the capabilities of modern browsers to run Augmented Reality applications. It uses the Opencv.js JavaScript binding for the OpenCV library. The library is compiled into WebAssembly, which creates a portable, size- and load-time-efficient binary format that modern browsers can understand. The Aruco Marker library from OpenCV was used to track the marker, and the Three.js library was used to construct a 3D cube, which is projected onto the marker. Below is an image of the demo running within the browser.
